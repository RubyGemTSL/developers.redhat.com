## Environments

The Docker setup for the developers.redhat.com project has the notions of environments.
The environment you will need to use depends on which version of the site you want to use.
Environment support was introduced to allow for the development and support of Drupal, whilst maintaining the old development workflow.

You should read the [environments README.md](environments/README.md) for more information.
